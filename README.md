# C-Programs

Welcome to my C++ program repository! This collection showcases my passion for programming and the knowledge I have acquired in the fascinating world of C++. While the programs included here may appear straightforward, they serve as stepping stones in my continuous journey of learning and exploration.

Programs Included

Array Splitter and Sorter::
This program exemplifies my ability to handle arrays and implement essential functions in C++. The program allows the user to input up to 20 integer values via the keyboard. It then splits the numbers into two arrays, "positive" and "negative," and displays the sorted values in ascending order for each array.

Grade Analysis and Letter Conversion
This program offers a professional solution for analyzing grades with precision and efficiency. By allowing users to input their grades, it accurately calculates the sum and average, providing valuable insights into academic performance. The program displays the grades with asterisks for those below the average and converts grades into their respective letter equivalents.

About Me
